- EDA was performed on the full dataset to understand what factors contribute to helpfulness of reviews.
-	First finding was that while the fraction of verified reviews since 2008 increased by 58%, the helpfulness of the reviews has decreased significantly by 50% in these 10 years.

-	First factor that was considered was how number of reviews and word count per review has changed over the years.
-	Home and kitchen products started making up more than 50% of the total reviews since 2010 while book reviews have recently only been a small fraction of the total reviews. 
-	Another interesting pattern that was observed is that the word count per review has dropped by 78% since 2010 which may be due to a smaller fraction of book reviews.
-	This observation supports the hypothesis that lengthier reviews tend to be more helpful, and they are written mostly by book readers.


<b>Does helpfulness of reviews change by product type?</b> 
-	The products were categorized into two types – search products, that tend to be easy to evaluate before buying such as home and kitchen products, and experience products such as video games that are often assessed only after a user has interacted with the product.
-	An interesting finding was that a greater fraction of extreme reviews (or reviews with a rating of 1 or 5) tend to be comparatively more helpful for search products.
-	Lengthier reviews tend to be more helpful for experience products as we see the word count distribution at the bottom seems to be more right-skewed for home and kitchen reviews, but for video games it seems a bit more balanced. 
-	This makes sense since experience products are typically more difficult to assess before buying, so a long, detailed review can add more value for other buyers. 

<b> Comparing helpful vs non-helpful reviewers</b>
-	Word clouds were used to compare the usage of words by two different users – one with a strong history of writing helpful reviews and other whose past reviews have usually been unhelpful.
-	A clear difference was found as the words used by the helpful reviewer were descriptive, included relevant product details, while the non-helpful reviewer used a lot of adjectives and subjective words.
